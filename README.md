# Among-Us-Simple-Imposter-Finder
This is just a simple web based program that documents and calculates the chance that someone is the imposter. This is a fairly simple application just made with HTML, CSS and JS. As I said before, this is an early version and is really simple with probably a lot of bugs. I do plan on fixing it up over time. The basic features of this imposter finder are the 9 boxes aranged in a grid. 

When launching the imposter finder, it will ask you how many imposters are in the gamemode, answer accurately as that affects percentages
If you click on the options part of each square on the left, you will be able to change the colour associated with the square, each one is black by default
Then, you can use those boxes to add in if someone died, or if they were seen doing a task or were an imposter
Inputting inaccurate information can screw over the script

As I said before, this script was written quickly and there are probably still a lot of bugs in it. In the future, I will try to get rid of all the bugs and even have it record gameplay so you don't have to manually put it in though that is not in there yet. Feel free to make any modifications you want to this code although if you do plan on reupploading your modifications to github or another website please just put my name on it too and a link to my original repository. 

ENJOY THE IMPOSTER FINDER


THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MOBILE AND NORMAL VERSION IS THAT THE WEB VERSION HAS FEATURES THAT REQUIRE A MOUSE AND IS A BIT SIMPLER SO IT RUNS BETTER ON MOBILE
